//TODO INSTRUCTIONS:
//  1. Now that you have the code in IntelliJ on your computer, use VCS to "Share this project to your GitHub repo
//     that is attached to your student email.  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THIS REPO SET TO PRIVATE.
//  2. Run the app and familiarise yourself with the output and where each part of the output came from in the code.
//  3. There are multiple TO DO comments - follow this workflow when addressing EACH one:
//       a. Locate a single TO DO item that you want to work on
//       b. Add the required code to address it.
//       c. Commit the change to your local repository, making sure your commit message explains (briefly) what you did.
//       d. Push the change to your remote repository
//  4. REMEMBER TO USE THIS GITHUB WORKFLOW FOR EACH CHANGE - failure to use GitHub in this way will result in
//     a lower grade for the assignment as it is a software development tooling module.
// Hint: the week 2 syntax labs are a good support for completing this project
